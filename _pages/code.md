### cuPSS - A pseudospectral solver for systems of PDEs

Find [here](https://github.com/fcaballerop/cuPSS) a solver for generic systems of PDEs, deterministic or stochastic, written in C++ and CUDA.

See tutorials on how to write solvers [here](https://github.com/fcaballerop/cuPSS/wiki/Tutorials), and examples [here](https://github.com/fcaballerop/cuPSS/tree/main/examples).
