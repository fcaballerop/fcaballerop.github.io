My interests include varied aspects of active matter, including continuum theories for nonequilibrium phenomena, critical properties of phase transition driven by activity, and how these continuum models can be coarsegrained from microscopic details of the system. More recently I've been interested in how activity impacts the dynamics of interfaces in phase separated mixtures of active and passive materials, looking at coarse grained models for these interfaces from both numerical and analytical methods.
